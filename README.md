Pong is a classic arcade video game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles on either side of the screen and compete to hit a ball back and forth. 
The objective is to score points by successfully bouncing the ball past the opponent's paddle, creating an engaging and competitive experience that has remained popular since its release in 1972.
